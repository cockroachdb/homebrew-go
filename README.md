# Cockroach Go

**ðŸš« DEPRECATED! ðŸš«**

Our build system now compiles our C and C++ dependencies outside of cgo. This tap is no longer necessary and no longer yields a speedup over the standard Go toolchain. Please use the upstream Go toolchain instead:

```shell
$ brew uninstall cockroachdb/go/go
$ brew untap cockroachdb/go
$ brew install go
```

---

A [Homebrew] tap to install [Cockroach Labs]'s patched version of Go. This
currently includes the following patch:

  * [parallelbuilds-go1.8.patch], which enables parallel compilation of cgo.
    This vastly speeds up a fresh compilation of CockroachDB, which compiles
    RocksDB via cgo.

This repository may ship additional patches in the future, or it may
cease to exist entirely if patches are merged upstream.

[parallelbuilds-go1.8.patch]: https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/blob/c49869212687e3d3c86876f0074690b50e7b7f33/build/parallelbuilds-go1.8.patch


## Installation

With Homebrew installed, run:

```shell
$ brew install cockroachdb/go/go
```

If you've already installed Go via Homebrew, you'll be prompted to
unlink it first. You can do so preemptively with `brew unlink go`.
